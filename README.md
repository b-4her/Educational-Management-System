# Educational Management System
#### Video Demo:  <URL [HERE](https://youtu.be/GC_tZgSSwwM)>

## Overview
The **Educational Management System** is a simple, console-based project that I developed as part of my learning journey. 
It provides a central portal, called the **Main Menu**, where users can manage accounts and courses with basic functionality. 
The focus of this project was to practice coding skills, especially object-oriented programming, 
and learn how to handle common challenges in software development.

## Key Features
### For Students
- Enroll in courses, submit assignments, and manage profiles.  
- Withdraw from courses when necessary.  

### For Professors
- Create and manage courses.  
- Assign and grade student submissions.  

### Account Management
- Simple account creation and login system with email validation.  
- Profile management options for both students and professors.  

## Challenges and Solutions  
As a beginner project, I faced several challenges that required problem-solving:  

1. **EOFError Handling**  
   I encountered an **EOFError** that caused crashes during page transitions. Adding a `try-except` block solved the issue and ensured smoother transitions.  

2. **Logout Mechanism**  
   Initially, the logout feature would redirect users to unintended pages. I fixed this by modifying the logic to shut down the application entirely upon logout.  

3. **Control+C Shortcut Issues**  
   I attempted to use **Control+C** to let users navigate back to the previous page. However, this feature was inconsistent and sometimes caused unexpected behavior.
   While I couldn’t fully resolve this issue, it was a great learning experience.  

## Lessons Learned  
I completed this project in about 40 hours over five days. While it’s not a professional-grade system, 
it helped me improve my understanding of Python, error handling, and basic application structure. 
It also taught me the importance of careful planning and testing to avoid structural issues in the code.    

## Installation
To install the Educational Management System, follow these steps:
1. Download the `tabulate` module.
2. Run the program normally from the `project.py` file after downloading Python language.
3. If you want to use the fake users data provided, replace the empty `Users` and `Courses_Data` files with the ones inside the folder named `Fake Data`. You'll find the users' information inside a CSV file called `fake_users`. You can use this information to login and try the program.

## Usage
The usage part doesn't need to be explained. It's just a normal console project that users can run and sign up.
**Note:** In some cases, the Control+C shortcut to navigate back to the previous page may not work properly, 
requiring multiple clicks. If you encounter this issue, try clicking it several times until it functions correctly.

## Acknowledgments
The idea of the project was inspired by Dr. Mustafa's channel on YouTube called "Arabic Competitive Programming". The logic of the code structure and the code itself is all mine; I just took the main idea from the doctor to work on it.
