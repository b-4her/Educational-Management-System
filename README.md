# Educational Management System
#### Video Demo:  <[URL](https://youtu.be/GC_tZgSSwwM) HERE>
## Overview
The Educational Management System is all about making things easier for students and professors. Through a central portal called the Main Menu, users can manage their accounts and handle courses hassle-free. The system ensures security and privacy by checking email addresses and generating unique IDs for each user. Professors can effortlessly handle courses and assignments, while students can enroll in courses, submit assignments, and manage their profiles with ease. The Main Menu portal offers account creation and login options, with email validation and security questions for added safety. Professors can create courses, manage assignments, and grade submissions, while students can enroll, submit work, and withdraw from courses as needed. With everything in one place, the system ensures a smooth and secure academic experience for everyone involved.

## Problems Faced
Throughout the project's development, we faced various challenges, each demanding unique solutions to ensure smooth operation. Initially, we encountered the EOFError, causing sudden crashes during page transitions. It took thorough investigation to realize we needed to implement a Try Except EOFError mechanism to handle this issue effectively.

Another significant challenge arose with the logout feature, leading users to unintended pages upon selection. This was due to the complex interconnection of pages, emphasizing the need for better planning. Despite identifying the problem late, revamping the logout mechanism by opting for a complete application shutdown resolved the issue.

Despite our efforts, we struggled with the Control+C shortcut's functionality to navigate back to the previous page. Sometimes, it led to traversing multiple pages or encountered intermittent failures, indicating potential flaws in the project's structure. Although a perfect solution remained elusive, completing the project after approximately 40 hours of intensive work over five days taught me invaluable lessons.

## Installation
To install the Educational Management System, follow these steps:
1. Download the `tabulate` module.
2. Run the program normally from the `project.py` file after downloading Python language.
3. If you want to use the fake users data provided, replace the empty `Users` and `Courses_Data` files with the ones inside the folder named `Fake Data`. You'll find the users' information inside a CSV file called `fake_users`. You can use this information to login and try the program.

## Usage
The usage part doesn't need to be explained. It's just a normal console project that users can run and sign up.
**Note:** In some cases, the Control+C shortcut to navigate back to the previous page may not work properly, 
requiring multiple clicks. If you encounter this issue, try clicking it several times until it functions correctly.

## Acknowledgments
The idea of the project was inspired by Dr. Mustafa's channel on YouTube called "Arabic Competitive Programming". The logic of the code structure and the code itself is all mine; I just took the main idea from the doctor to work on it.
